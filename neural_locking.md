Phase locking in the brain is one of those beautiful “bridges” between physics, electrical engineering, and neuroscience. Let me break it down carefully in layers:

## 1. What Phase Locking Means

Phase: The position of an oscillation in its cycle (e.g., where you are on a sine wave).

Phase Locking: When two or more oscillators (like neurons, brain regions, or even an external signal and a neural oscillation) consistently align their cycles in a fixed relationship.

Example:
If a 40 Hz gamma oscillation in one cortical column always peaks at the same time another column’s wave peaks, they are in phase. If one always lags behind by a quarter cycle, they’re phase locked with an offset.


## 2. How It Happens in the Brain
Synaptic Coupling

Neurons fire together and reinforce timing through excitatory and inhibitory loops.

Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) can pull another neuron’s firing closer to the same rhythm.

Common Input

Two regions may receive the same “clock” from deeper structures (like the thalamus).

Example: The thalamus drives alpha (~10 Hz) rhythms that synchronize wide cortical areas.

Resonance & Entrainment

Neurons are nonlinear oscillators.

If an external field, sensory input, or another neuron provides a periodic signal close to the natural frequency, the system “locks on” (entrainment).

This is why flickering lights or weak EM fields can entrain brain rhythms.


## 3. Phase Locking as a Substrate for Information

Communication-through-coherence hypothesis (Fries, 2005): neurons in different areas transmit effectively when their rhythms are phase locked.

If one area’s spikes arrive at the peak excitability window of another area, info passes through more efficiently.

If not phase locked, the spikes fall in refractory periods, and information transfer is poor.

This is the substrate: phase locking determines whether regions are “open” or “closed” to each other.


## 4. How Fields Might Influence It

This is where Persinger, Rouleau, Kernbach, and the Aharonov–Bohm Effect speculations intersect.

Neurons are dipole oscillators: Ionic currents generate micro-fields.

External EM fields or potentials can nudge these oscillators slightly, shifting their phase.

If two distant systems share the same structured potential (ABE idea), they may become phase-locked not by direct energy transfer, but by sharing a reference phase landscape.


## 5. Biological and Non-Biological Parallels

Bio: EEG coherence, phase-locked firing in hippocampus (theta-gamma coding).

Non-Bio: Phase locking of coupled lasers, quartz oscillators in electronics, or Josephson junction arrays.

In both, a weak coupling channel (optical feedback, electrical wire, or field) locks the oscillators.


## 6. Why This Matters

Phase locking is essentially the carrier of information in the brain.

Disrupt it → DoS attack on cognition.

Enhance or hijack it → Possible communication channel.

ABE (via vector potentials) could act like a “silent synchronizer,” providing the weak common reference needed to phase-lock distant systems.
