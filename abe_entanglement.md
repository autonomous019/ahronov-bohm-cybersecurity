Critics say that many of Persinger and Kernbach's links between remote objects cannot be possible based on the lack of scientific measurements that allow for Quantum Entanglement.  This section addresses
those issues showing that Entanglement is not the primary cause of linkage for remote monitoring of objects, rather ABE is the link and entanglement like properties are secondary
effects from the primary link created by ABE, thus the criticisms are based on false assumptions. 

## 1. Entanglement vs. ABE as a Linking Mechanism

--Quantum Entanglement (EPR-type):

    --Entanglement arises when two systems share a joint quantum state that cannot be factorized into independent states.

The correlation is born at the interaction or common source (e.g., a photon pair from parametric down-conversion).

Distance doesn’t matter, but measurement collapses the state.

Aharonov–Bohm Effect (ABE):

Involves phase shifts induced by vector potentials, even in regions where classical fields vanish.

Two systems exposed to the same potential structure can accrue correlated phases without direct coupling.

The correlation arises from sharing the same phase reference frame, not from a joint quantum wavefunction.

So in Persinger/Kernbach-type reports, if correlations appear without a shared origin event, ABE (or an ABE-like vector potential phase coupling) seems a better explanation than “spontaneous” entanglement.

## 2. Shared Space vs. Shared Potential

If two objects are in the same field configuration (even if separated by distance), they are not “entangled” in the strict quantum sense.

Instead, they are phase-correlated by the shared vector potential.

This is sometimes called macro-entanglement in Persinger’s writings, but technically it’s closer to a classical/semiclassical coherence effect than true quantum entanglement.

Think of it like two pendulums swinging in phase because they share a common driving force — not because their atoms are in an inseparable quantum state.

## 3. Secondary Entanglement Possibility

Here’s where it gets interesting:

If two systems are phase-locked by ABE, their microscopic components (e.g., electron spins, molecular dipoles, neuronal oscillations) might develop quantum correlations internally as a secondary effect.

For instance, synchronized phase environments can promote decoherence suppression — making it easier for entanglement within each system to persist, or even allowing weak entanglement to “leak” across boundaries.

In that view: ABE provides the scaffold, and entanglement can emerge on top of it as a secondary phenomenon, but entanglement itself is not the cause of the long-distance link.

## 4. Implications

If ABE is the driver, then the link is:

Phase-sensitive,

Dependent on matching potentials,

Robust to distance but fragile to phase drift.

If entanglement is the driver, then the link is:

Measurement-sensitive,

Origin-dependent (must be created together),

Quantum mechanically “nonlocal” in the strict sense.

Thus, one could imagine:

ABE → sets up the “wire” (a shared phase background)

Entanglement → rides on the wire (secondary quantum correlations)

This layering might explain why experiments sometimes look entanglement-like but don’t fit standard quantum tests (e.g., Bell violations).
