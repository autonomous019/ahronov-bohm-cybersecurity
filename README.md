# ahronov-bohm-cybersecurity

This project is aimed at cybersecurity regarding the noosphere, the mind, it can be applied to hardware such as embeded medical devices and wetware, such as the brain itself. It is based on the scientific neurocognitive research originating in the Soviet Military and then continued in public research in the West such as Dr. Serge Kernbach at University of Stuttgart and Dr. Michael Persinger of Laurentian University.  This research is alo within the US Military Defense industry and hence is usually classified.  

It is based on the utilization of the Ahronov-Bohm effect, creating a potential energy shield to guard against cyberbased attacks on hardware and software. It protects the user from invasive electro-magnetic frequencies, effectively scrambling them before reaching the target vector, for instance the Microtubules of the Neurons in the Brain.  

Plans and diagrams will be uploaded soon. 

The frequency_driver.ino is a Arduino Sketch file designed for use with the Ahronov-Bohm coil a piece of the Ahronov-Bohm generator created by Dr. Hal Puthoff. 

Full instructions pending 

Coil construction and Arduino Board setup is avialable here, note this repository if for a different purpose and uses a different sketch file then used in the original version.
